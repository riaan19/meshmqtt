# MeshMQTT

MeshMQTT integrates Meshtastic with a private MQTT broker and provides a web dashboard for creating sensors in Home Assistant on a Raspberry Pi.

This is for my own use and should not really be used by anyone else; if you break it or your own equipment or even strain the LoRa network, not my problem. I'm posting it here for my own reference. There is 0 security when hosting this. Make sure you know what you are doing.

## Overview

This project connects Meshtastic LoRa devices to a private MQTT broker, enabling seamless integration with Home Assistant. It includes a web dashboard to manage and visualize sensor data, designed to run on a Raspberry Pi for home automation applications.

## Prerequisites

- **Raspberry Pi**: Models 2, 3, 4, 5, Zero, or Zero 2 W (Pi 4/5 recommended for best performance).
- **Operating System**: Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit or 64-bit recommended).
- **Meshtastic Device**: A compatible LoRa radio connected via USB or serial.
- **Internet Connection**: Required for downloading dependencies and cloning the repository.
- **Storage**: At least 2 GB of free space on the SD card.
- **User Permissions**: Access to a user account with `sudo` privileges.
- **Git**: Required to clone and update the repository.

## Installation

The `install_meshmqtt.sh` script automates the setup process, installing dependencies, setting up a virtual environment, and configuring the service to run on boot. It dynamically uses the current logged-in user's home directory.

### Steps to Install

1. **Install Git** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y git
   ```

   Verify installation:

   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

2. **Download the Repository** (if not already cloned):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/riaan19/meshmqtt.git
   cd meshmqtt
   ```

3. **Make the Script Executable**:

   ```bash
   chmod +x install_meshmqtt.sh
   ```

4. **Run the Installation Script**:

   ```bash
   sudo ./install_meshmqtt.sh
   ```

5. **Verify the Service**:

   - Check the service status:

     ```bash
     sudo systemctl status meshmqtt.service
     ```
   - View logs for debugging:

     ```bash
     journalctl -u meshmqtt.service
     ```

6. **Access the Dashboard**:

   - Open a browser and navigate to `http://<raspberry-pi-ip>:5000` (replace `<raspberry-pi-ip>` with your Pi's IP address).
   - Check `mesh_dashboard.py` for the exact port if different.

## Updating

To update MeshMQTT to the latest version:

1. **Navigate to the Repository**:

   ```bash
   cd ~/meshmqtt
   ```

2. **Pull the Latest Changes**:

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

   If you encounter conflicts, you may need to stash or reset local changes:

   ```bash
   git stash
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. **Update Dependencies**: Activate the virtual environment and update Python packages:

   ```bash
   source ~/meshmqtt/venv/bin/activate
   pip install --upgrade meshtastic paho-mqtt flask
   deactivate
   ```

4. **Restart the Service**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart meshmqtt.service
   ```

5. **Verify the Update**: Check the service status to ensure itâ€™s running:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status meshmqtt.service
   ```

## Configuration

- **Meshtastic Device**: Ensure your LoRa radio is connected via USB or serial. Update `config.json` (if used) with the correct serial port or device settings.
- **MQTT Broker**: Configure MQTT settings in `config.json` or the main script if required.
- **Customizations**: Edit `mesh_dashboard.py` or other files in `~/meshmqtt` (your home directory) for specific configurations.

## Troubleshooting

- **Service Fails to Start**:
  - Check logs: `journalctl -u meshmqtt.service`
  - Ensure the Meshtastic device is connected and the serial port is correct.
  - Verify `mesh_dashboard.py` exists and is error-free.
- **Dependency Issues**:
  - Rerun `sudo apt install -y libffi-dev libssl-dev` and `pip install` commands in the virtual environment.
- **Dashboard Not Accessible**:
  - Confirm the Pi's IP address (`hostname -I`) and port.
  - Check firewall settings or network connectivity.

## Notes

- The script assumes `mesh_dashboard.py` is the main script. Update the systemd service file (`/etc/systemd/system/meshmqtt.service`) if your main script has a different name.
- The script uses the current logged-in user's home directory (e.g., `/home/<your-username>/meshmqtt`) for installation.
- For Raspberry Pi Zero or older models, ensure sufficient memory (consider increasing swap space) to handle dependency installation.
- If using a non-Raspberry Pi OS, modify the script's package installation commands (e.g., use `dnf` for Fedora-based systems).
